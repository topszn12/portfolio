        <hr>
        <p>I never really thought myself as much of a leader. Maybe it’s because I never really liked being a leader; it honestly just seems like too much responsibility. But there have been moments in my life when I realized that I needed to step up. I recall back in high school, I was struggling to find ways to get involved or to display leadership outside of school; so I decided to do something different. I made a pact with myself that I would create something awesome and I would do it by assembling my own team.</p>
        <p>This idea of trying to create something came from my struggle to find scholarships before heading off to college. Admittedly, I never really participated in much throughout high school, so it was difficult for me to demonstrate to scholarship committees that I was worthy enough to receive any scholarships; though my grades were exceptional it wasn’t enough to distinguish me from other candidates.</p>
        <p>That’s where I decided to assemble a team of students that found themselves in a similar situation. Our mission was to create an app that would allow students to search for scholarships that fit their unique situation. I believed everyone has different circumstances, so I wanted to create an experience that was tailored to fit any student. The only problem was, we had very little experience developing anything. That and the lack of proper leadership made this a very difficult task.</p>
        <p>About a month into development, I noticed that we were not really getting anywhere. Our team lacked a vision and was heavily demotivated due to the lack of progress. In that moment, everyone wanted to quit. I also wanted to quit, but I just couldn’t allow myself to. Given the circumstances, I stepped down from a development role and focused more and leading my team. Though I still became involved with some the programming aspects, my main priority was to make sure everyone was on the same page and that we all had the same end goal.</p>
        <p>Surely enough, this worked out for the better. I was able to provide guidance for my team members and they were able to play their part as well. By the end of the school year, we had a working prototype which we presented to the entire senior class. It was a really good feeling to get that far. This whole process of conceptualizing something and bringing it to life was unlike anything I’ve ever accomplished. It made me realize that I was capable of being a leader.</p>
        <p>I think what I took most from that experience was that in order to be a good leader, you have to care about what you do. It’s what drove to really push myself and make sure that I accomplished the goals I set both for me and my team.</p>
