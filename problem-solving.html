        <hr>
        <p>One the biggest issues many programming beginners run into is thinking that there is only one way to accomplish a task. This was something I personally dealt with when I was first starting to program, but it wasn’t something I learned to really overcome till I got my first internship.</p>
        <p>I was hired a generalist for a marketing position -- which basically entailed being able to do just about everything from research, design, and you guessed it, programming. Now it had a been a while since I programmed any sort of application given the fact that I changed my major, but it was something that I still had an affinity for. </p>
        <p>A week goes by into my internship and I receive my first project. Right off the bat, I’m assigned a Raspberry Pi, which is essentially a juice box sized, affordable computer that is utilized for scalable projects that are set to go into production. Surely enough I’m assigned to modify in order to complete certain functions which included switching computer screens and even responding to user based scans with smartphones. But before I could even begin to document any sort of code, I had to get the original program to run first.</p>
        <p>No matter how many times I ran the complier, my machine would not run. I began to worry due to my supervisor’s concern about my abilities to complete the project and even began to doubt my own skill set. Nothing I tried worked. I swore to myself that I followed the setup instructions clearly, yet still no results. This made me quite discouraged but throughout this process, I learned some of the most important lessons in troubleshooting when dealing with software. First and foremost, programming is always frustrating. Secondly, sometimes in order to fix a software problem, you first have to fix a hardware problem.</p>
        <p>After countless hours of work trying to get the machine to run, I stumble upon a forum in which a programmer was working a similar project. Their machine was not running as well, but something stood out to me. The person on the forum never once mentioned modifying the code; which is something I did. Instead, their issue was regarding hardware; a factor I hadn’t considered before. It was at that exact moment where I did the biggest facepalm of my life. After placing my finger on top of the computer in order to hold the case down, I ran the program again. This time, my program compiled.</p>
        <p>Here I was all this time thinking something was wrong with the code. It never once struck me how sensitive the machine I was working on was. One loose screw, and the computer no longer processes everything correctly. It took me a while to pick up on that, but this was only possible for me after I observed the problem beyond how I regularly approached it.</p>
        <p>I learned from this situation that in order to solve a problem, you have become very familiar with a situation. What I mean by that, is that although I knew what a Raspberry Pi was, I had never worked on one before; I just assumed it would be like any other computer I worked on. Because of that, I struggled through solving my problem and it hindered my production.</p>
        <p>All in all, it was an experience I’m thankful for because it is something I apply to most of my problems. Nowadays, before I even begin to think of a solution, I always make sure to do my research in order to understand what is I’m really dealing with.</p>
