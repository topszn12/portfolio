        <hr>
        <p>When I was a junior in highschool, I received a take home test for calculus. Calculus was never my best subject so I went above and beyond to try and study for tests. Some of the strategies I used for studying were using online practice tests, studying past exams, and AP Exam Books. The issue with this situation, was that the take home test I received was a test I had previously come across on one of the AP Exam Books. I new every answer. I knew how to do all the work for the problems -- even though I didn’t understand all of them completely. The point is, I remembered every single problem and how to work it out. </p>
        <p>When I realized this, I knew it would bring up issues with the teacher. I wasn’t the best student, but as I mentioned before, I’ve already practiced this test before. Let’s just say it would look strange for me to turn in a perfect exam knowing I was only an average student in calculus. Long story short, I turned it in with all the questions correct. I figured it really didn’t make sense to purposely get the questions wrong because the reality was, I already knew the answers.</p>
        <p>Of course, this prompted my teacher to question me about the exam grade. I wouldn’t blame her, 
        but at the same time, I was completely honest about the situation. I told her everything and I explained 
        that I didn’t use the book at all while taking the exam she assigned us. Not like I really needed it anyway, 
        I memorized most of the problems from multiple exams. She was shocked at my honesty. </p>
        <p>Did I have access to this exam before? I did. But I never predicted that this specific book I obtained would contain a future exam. It was purely coincidental. If anything, I felt like my role in this, was to demonstrate the problem with recycling exams. She took that advice well and from then on never used an old exam ever again.</p>
        <p>She ended up deducting 20 points from my grade as well. Not sure if that was necessary, but I guess she felt it was the proper thing to do. Nowadays, whenever I run into old material, I make sure to contact my professors about whether or not they allow the usage of past content. It makes the situation easier to explain and some professors will specifically tell you whether or not they allow this type of studying. Overall, this was a huge lesson for me to learn about ethics because it taught me that what I think classifies as cheating can vary depending on the person and that you should never assume something is right because if favors your situation.</p>
